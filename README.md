# Assembler

For this project I had to design an Instruction Set Architecture and implement an assembler for the same. I used the C++ programming language for the implementation of the assembler. The assembler inputs the symbolic program in the form of a .txt file and outputs the machine code representation as a string of 0’s and 1’s on the terminal. The instructions are fixed length instructions of length 32 bits each.
